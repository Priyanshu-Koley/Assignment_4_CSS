Assignment 4 - CSS

We can achieve the given task in two Methods, I have implemented both of them.
    Method 1:

        We can use the image as background image and then apply background-size = cover to Image 1 and 2 , background-position = top center to Image 1 and background-position = bottom center to Image 2.

        Folder name: Assignment_4_Method_1_CSS
        Files names: assignment_4_method_1.html, assignment_4_method_1_style.css

    Method 2:

        We can display the image in img tag and then apply object-fit = cover to both the image 1 and 2, object-position = top to Image 1 and object-position = bottom to Image 2.

        Folder name: Assignment_4_Method_2_CSS
        Files names: assignment_4_method_2.html, assignment_4_method_2_style.css

As mentioned by Firoja Ma'am I have only submitted the Method 2 as I feel that this implementation is most optimized :
    1) Accessibility: <img> tags are inherently accessible. Screen readers and other assistive technologies can better interpret and convey the content of an image when using <img> tags.
    2) SEO: Search engines can better understand and index images when using <img> tags with appropriate alt attributes.
